# Windows 95 Desktop Web Emulation
Written by Thomas Roos

## Project Description
Created with the intent of re-creating the Windows 95 operating system in a website. In doing so I'm trying to challenge myself both in terms of graphic design and designing
a large scale project that can encapsulate several layers of nested websites. I'd like to make it possible to host my other creative projects within the sphere of this project.
In the screenshot below you can see a window labeled "The Internet", while it won't directly have access to the actual internet, I'd like to make it so that users can peruse my other 
passion projects as a sort of makeshift "internet". Additionally, I'd like to challenge myself by making the infrastructure both in terms of coding/file management and database formatting
as scalable as possible. I wish to explore the possibility of making my copycat OS as customizable as possible with as little change needed as possible. Hence, I want to ensure that while
I code this project I can do it in a way that lets me sepparate actual values from existing directly in the code, and make it purely fetched through either local storage or database storing.

Finally, you might be asking why is it modeled after Windows 95? Well its simply because I quite like the aesthetic and graphic design choices.
